# tjikko/components

## Install
This is a private package so for now you'll need to ask for access to the npm org…
```
npm i @tjikko/components
```

## Usage
Import the component you want and use it how the docs describe!

## Docs and Playground
You can play around with the components in Storybook and that's also where you'll find documentation for the components, until we host them somewhere more accessible. Not that there are a lot of docs…

To launch Storybook:
```
git clone git@github.com:tjikko-studio/components.git
cd components
npm i
npm run dev
```
